# My self learning plan

only papers and my notes aim to push myself.



## Intro

The days when I can't find a job are very boring and anxious. I decided to set a goal of one paper a week to motivate myself.

The project includes the original text of the paper and the notes I wrote. The notes are mainly written in Chinese in the form of markdown. Most of the papers will not include code to reproduce.

This item is mainly for personal use. Maybe the understanding of the paper I wrote was not deep enough, which led to ridicule by my peers. But for me, better late than never.

:warning: please install [MathJax](https://github.com/orsharir/github-mathjax) if your chrome cannot display formula in a right way. If it cannot display in the right way, try restart chrome or reflash.
